# Archived Documentation

This directory contains archived documentation that has been superseded by newer, consolidated documents.

## Archived Files

### Architecture Documents (Consolidated into /ARCHITECTURE.md)
- `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_ARCHIVED.md` - Original system architecture and vision
- `PARALLAX_ARCHITECTURE_ARCHIVED.md` - Detailed technical architecture
- `PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE_ARCHIVED.md` - Package structure documentation

### Specialized Documents
- `multi-tenancy.md` - Multi-tenancy design (now in ARCHITECTURE.md)
- `prism-complete-assessment.md` - Prism language assessment
- `prism-ecosystem-integration.md` - Prism integration details
- `PATTERN_GENERATION_ARCHITECTURE_GAP.md` - Pattern generation gap analysis (merged into PATTERN_SDK_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - Legacy roadmap (superseded by /ROADMAP.md)
- `OPEN_SOURCE_LAUNCH_STRATEGY.md` - Legacy launch strategy (superseded by REVISED_OPENSOURCE_STRATEGY.md)

## Why These Were Archived

These documents were archived because:
1. Multiple overlapping architecture documents caused confusion
2. Information was consolidated into a single `/ARCHITECTURE.md` file
3. Some content was outdated or superseded by implementation

## When to Reference

Reference these archived documents when:
- Looking for historical context on design decisions
- Needing detailed information that may not have made it to the consolidated docs
- Understanding the evolution of the architecture

## Current Documentation

For current information, see:
- `/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete system architecture
- `/ROADMAP.md` - Development roadmap and status
- `/README.md` - Getting started guide
