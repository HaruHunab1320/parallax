## Overview

Parallax is an AI agent orchestration platform that coordinates swarms of specialized agents using the Prism uncertainty-aware language. Built on the "orchestra philosophy" where agents focus on their expertise while Parallax conducts their collective intelligence.

## Core Concepts

1. **[Orchestra Philosophy](./concepts/orchestra-philosophy.md)** - Why agents work better when they don't talk to each other
2. **Uncertainty Programming** - Using Prism's confidence operators (`~`, `~>`) 
3. **Coordination Patterns** - Reusable patterns for common orchestration needs
4. **Agent Independence** - Building focused, simple agents that do one thing well

## Documentation Structure
