PROJECT PROPOSAL: AI-Powered Customer Support System

Executive Summary:
We propose implementing an AI-powered customer support system that will reduce average response time from 24 hours to under 5 minutes for 70% of incoming tickets. This $450,000 investment is projected to save $1.2M annually in support costs while improving customer satisfaction scores by 25%.

Background:
Our current support team handles approximately 50,000 tickets per month. Analysis shows that 65% of these tickets are routine questions that could be handled automatically with accurate AI responses. Our NPS score has dropped 15 points over the past year, with customers citing slow response times as their primary complaint.

Proposed Solution:
Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Deploy AI chatbot for tier-1 support
- Implement natural language understanding for common queries
- Integrate with existing knowledge base
- Set up human escalation workflows
- Target: Handle 40% of tickets automatically

Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Advanced capabilities
- Add sentiment analysis to prioritize upset customers
- Implement proactive support suggestions
- Build agent assist tools for complex cases
- Target: Handle 70% of tickets automatically

Phase 3 (Months 7-9): Optimization
- Fine-tune models based on feedback
- Add multilingual support (Spanish, French, German)
- Implement predictive issue detection
- Target: 85% automation rate

Budget Breakdown:
- AI Platform licensing: $180,000/year
- Integration development: $150,000 (one-time)
- Training and change management: $50,000
- Ongoing maintenance: $70,000/year
Total Year 1: $450,000

Expected ROI:
- Reduced headcount needs: $800,000 savings
- Faster resolution improves retention: $300,000 value
- Reduced escalations: $100,000 savings
Net benefit Year 1: $750,000

Risks and Mitigation:
1. AI accuracy concerns - Extensive testing and gradual rollout
2. Customer resistance to bots - Optional human escalation always available
3. Integration complexity - Dedicated technical team allocated

Timeline:
- Approval needed by: February 15, 2026
- Kickoff: March 1, 2026
- Phase 1 complete: June 1, 2026
- Full deployment: December 1, 2026

Recommendation:
We strongly recommend approval of this proposal. The combination of cost savings, improved customer experience, and competitive necessity makes this investment essential. Several competitors have already implemented similar systems, and we risk falling behind if we delay.
