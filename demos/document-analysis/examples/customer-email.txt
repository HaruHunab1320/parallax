Subject: Extremely frustrated with your service - considering cancellation

Hi,

I've been a loyal customer for THREE YEARS and I have never been this disappointed with your service.

Last week, I placed an order for the Premium Package (Order #78234) which was supposed to arrive within 2 business days as advertised. It's now been 8 days and I still don't have my order. I've called your support line FOUR times and each time I'm told something different:

- Call 1: "It shipped, should arrive tomorrow" - it didn't
- Call 2: "There's a slight delay, 2 more days" - nothing
- Call 3: "We need to investigate" - no follow up
- Call 4: "I don't see any notes on your account" - SERIOUSLY?!

I spent over $2,000 on this order because I needed it for an important client presentation that is NOW RUINED. This isn't just an inconvenience - this has actually cost me business.

What I want:
1. My order delivered TODAY (not tomorrow, not "soon" - TODAY)
2. A full refund of the shipping charges
3. Some kind of credit for the absolute nightmare this has been
4. A direct phone number to someone who can actually help if this happens again

If I don't hear back from someone with actual authority within 24 hours, I will:
- Cancel my subscription immediately
- Dispute the charge with my credit card company
- Leave detailed negative reviews on every platform I can find

I really didn't want it to come to this. I've recommended your company to dozens of people over the years. But this experience has completely shattered my trust.

Please make this right.

Regards,
