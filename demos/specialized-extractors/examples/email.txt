Hi Lisa,

Thanks for getting back to me so quickly about the Henderson project. I wanted to follow up on our call from yesterday and confirm the key details we discussed.

As we agreed, the revised timeline looks like this:
- Phase 1 kickoff: December 15, 2023
- Phase 1 completion: January 31, 2024
- Phase 2 completion: March 15, 2024
- Final delivery: April 30, 2024

For the budget, here's what we're looking at:
- Phase 1: $28,500
- Phase 2: $42,000
- Phase 3: $19,500
Total project cost: $90,000

Please send the signed contract to our office at:
VendorCo Inc.
Attn: Contracts Department
555 Commerce Street, Floor 12
Chicago, IL 60601

I'll also need you to loop in your CFO, Margaret Williams, on the payment terms discussion. We can set up a call with her and our finance director, Tom Anderson, for next week.

Let me know if you have any questions. Looking forward to working with ClientCorp on this!

Best regards,
David Martinez
